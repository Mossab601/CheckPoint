# Algorithm Exercise Progression

This repository contains a series of algorithmic exercises designed to improve problem-solving and programming skills, progressing from beginner to advanced levels. The exercises start at 10% proficiency, gradually increasing in complexity up to 100%.

## Exercise Categories and Completion Progress

Each exercise contributes to a percentage of your algorithmic mastery. The following list shows the exercises grouped by their current completion level.


### Intermediate Level 1 (10%) :
*Building on the basics, these exercises introduce more complexity.*

### Intermediate Level 2 (20%) :
*These exercises expand your problem-solving ability.*

### Advanced Level 1 (35%) :
*In this stage, youâ€™ll encounter more challenging exercises.*

### Advanced Level 2 (50%) :
*These exercises require a higher degree of algorithmic knowledge.*

### Expert Level 1 (65%) :
*These exercises are for those with strong proficiency in algorithms.*

### Expert Level 2 (75%) :
*At this level, you are approaching full mastery.*

### Master Level 1 (85%) :
*For the true algorithmic experts, these exercises require creative thinking and problem-solving.*

### Master Level 2 (95%) :
*Near-complete proficiency.*

### Complete Mastery (100%) :
*Achieving this level means you're able to solve the most complex algorithmic challenges.*

## How to Use
Each exercise is a standalone challenge that helps you develop specific skills. You can start with the exercises at 10% and work your way up to the ones at 100%. The goal is to solve these problems while gradually improving your ability to think algorithmically and implement efficient solutions.

## Contribution
